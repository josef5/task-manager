# Task Manager

Uses React, Vite, TypeScript and Tailwind.

Simply run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open:
http://localhost:5173/

State management logic is in `store.ts` and this is provided to all components via the Context API. This would need extending to syncronise with server/db state.
